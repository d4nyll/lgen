For the AppStore upload

Using Sierra OS, XCode 7.3

XCode 8 requires a change of Swift code, which is risky as it could create regression with cordova plugin

We are using XCode 7.3 to avoid this but we cannot upload an app with it !
So we build, archive the app and export as IPA

We need to use XCode 8 to upload the app so we use the Application Loader of XCode 8 (version 3.6)
