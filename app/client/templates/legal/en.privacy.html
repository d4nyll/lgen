            <h3>How is children’s personal information treated?</h3>

            <p>
              We have included some information below related to the Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act
              (“COPPA”). COPPA requires that online service providers obtain parental consent or provide notice before
              they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13 (“under
              age users”). Pursuant to COPPA, we may collect an underage user’s name (first name and last initial), date
              of birth, email address and/or telephone number in order to operate and provide the Smartix
              Services, and we may collect the underage user’s parent’s (or legal guardian’s) email address in order to
              provide notice to parents that we may contact their underage user for the purpose of providing the
              Services. If Smartix does not receive the parent’s email address within a reasonable time period,
              the underage user will not be able to receive any messages and
              <strong>his/her personally identifiable information will be deleted.</strong>
              If an underage user’s Smartix account is inactive for at least twelve months (meaning, the account
              has not received a message through the Services in that period of time), Little Genius’s policy is to
              delete the personally-identifiable information. If we learn we have collected Personal Information from an
              underage user other than pursuant to the above, or if we learn that an underage user has provided us
              personal information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as
              possible. If you believe that an underage user may have provided us personal information in violation of
              this paragraph, please contact us at
              <a href="mailto:report@littlegenius.io">report@littlegenius.io</a>.

              Smartix collects limited personal information from users under 13, and notifies a parent or guardian
              when collecting personal information from users under 13 years old. We will delete their personal
              information if the child’s account does not have an associated email address from a parent or guardian, or
              if the account has been inactive for at least 12 months. Any questions or concerns? Just email us!

              When you use the Services, you may set up your personal profile, send messages, perform searches and
              queries, and transmit information through various channels as permitted by the functionality of the

              information to provide the Services to you and our other users and to provide a useful user experience.
              When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of

              address, Smartix cookie information, the page you requested, and other usage information such as

            Little Genius may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner
            that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us and our partners authorized by us

            <h3>What about cookies, Pixels and Local Storage?</h3>

            <p>
              Cookies are small files that websites place on your computer as you browse the web. Like many websites,
              Smartix uses cookies to discover how people are using our Services and to make them work better.
            </p>

            <p>
              A pixel is a small amount of code on a web page or in an email notification. As many services do, we (or
              our Agents) may use pixels to learn whether you’ve interacted with certain of web or email content on our
              Services. This helps us measure and improve our Services and personalize your experience on Smartix.
            </p>

            <p>
              Local storage is an industry-standard technology that allows a website or application to store information
              locally on your computer or mobile device. We use local storage to customize what we show you based on
              your past interactions with Smartix.
            </p>

            <p>
              Smartix uses these technologies to deliver, measure, and improve our Services in various ways. These
              uses generally fall into one of the following categories:
            </p>

            <ul class="list-bulleted block copy">

                <h4>Authentication and security:</h4>

                <ul class="list-bulleted block copy">
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      To log you into Smartix.
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>
                      To protect your security.
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>
                      To help us detect and fight spam, abuse, and other activities that violate the Smartix
                      Rules.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  For example, these technologies help authenticate your access to Smartix and prevent
                  unauthorized parties from accessing your account. They also let us show you appropriate content
                  through our Services.
                </p>

                </ul>

                <p>
                  For example, cookies may help us remember your preferred language or country that you are in. We can
                  then provide you with Smartix content in your preferred language without having to ask you each
                  time you visit Smartix. We can also customize content based on your country, such as disabling
                  SMS, or to withhold certain content based on applicable local laws.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <h4>Analytics and research:</h4>

                <ul class="list-bulleted block copy">
                  <li>To help us improve and understand how people use our Services.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  For example, cookies help us test different versions of our services to see which particular features
                  or content users prefer. We might also optimize and improve your experience on Smartix by using
                  cookies to see how you interact with our services, such as when and how often you use them and what
                  links you click on. We may use Google Analytics to assist us with this.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from
              accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you
              to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the
              cookies activated, however, because you will not be able to log in or use many of the Services’ features
              without cookies enabled. Note that the use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our privacy
              policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.

              All users have the choice of associating their account with a school or other organization. This may be
              required (for example) for teachers and may be either required or strongly encouraged for other types of
              Organizers (as defined in the
              <a href="/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a>) in order to use certain features of the Services. By
              doing so, you are aware that an administrator, principal, technology specialist, or other party authorized
              by the school or organization may be able to view your Content upon proper validation of such person’s
              credentials. As an Organizer, you also acknowledge that Smartix may enable other persons who are
              associated with the same organization to contact each other -- for example, teachers, students, or parents
              who are associated with the same school or district. By associating your account with an organization,
              those persons may be able to view Content already in the account as well as future submissions and
              Content. Smartix will endeavor to notify Organizers (and/or relevant Subscribers) upon making that
              Content available. In addition, these persons may be able to make administrative changes to your account,
              such as, but not limited to, adding subscribers, removing subscribers, sending messages on your behalf and
              more. They will not be able to delete Content already submitted.

              unrevised information in our records. Certain types of communication you send to other users cannot be
              removed, such as messages.

              You may request deletion of your Smartix account by emailing <a
              href="mailto:contact@littlegenius.io">contact@littlegenius.io</a>.
              Please note that certain information may remain in our records, server logs and archives after deletion of
              your account. Smartix retains this information for purposes such as diagnosing problems with the
              service and for auditing legal investigations, but reserves the right to delete this information in
              accordance with its standard business practices in effect from time to time. Further, information and
              other content you have provided may remain visible elsewhere to the extent such content was copied or
              stored by other users.
            </p>

            <p>
              For under age users with an account that is inactive for twelve months or more (meaning the account has
              not received a message through the Services in that time), Smartix’s policy is to disable access to
              Personal Information associated with that account.

              If yours or your child’s personal information changes, or if you no longer desire our Service, wish to
              refuse further contact by Smartix with your child, you may review, correct, update, delete
              inaccuracies, request deletion of your child’s information, or amend it by contacting us at
              <a href="mailto:contact@littlegenius.io">contact@littlegenius.io</a> or by logging into your account. We
              will respond to your request as quickly as possible.
            </p>

            <p>
              We will retain yours or your child’s information for as long as your account is active or as needed to
              provide Services. If you wish to cancel yours or your child’s account or request that we no longer use the
              information to provide Services, contact us at
              <a href="mailto:contact@littlegenius.io">contact@littlegenius.io</a>.
              Note we will retain and use information, for example, to comply with our audit and legal obligations, to
              resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements.
