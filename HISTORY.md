#1.1 (target end of dev: 18-April => release: 25-April)
- New scalable architecture
- Upgrade to Meteor 1.3: improves the performance on iOS and better hot code push
The 2 changes above need to rolled out asap so that we do not do a big bang release (i.e architecture + 
many functional items) and high risk of regression  when delivering all functional features.
