                            Before using Little Genius, you need to be at least 18 years old, and agree to these terms. If you’re under 18, a parent or guardian needs to agree to these terms for you.

                            We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so this Agreement may need to change along with the Services. We reserve the right to modify this Agreement at any time, but we will do our best to bring this to your attention by posting a notice on the Services, sending you a notice via email, and/or by some other means. If you don’t agree with the new terms, you may reject them but unfortunately you will no longer be able to use the Services. Your use of the Services in any way following such notification constitutes your acceptance of the terms and conditions as modified. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services, at any time. We’ll do our best to provide you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical.

                        <p>
                            You represent and warrant to Little Genius that: (i) you are at least 18 years old (or, if you are not at least 18 years old, you have your parent’s permission to use the Services, and your parent has read and agrees to this Agreement on your behalf); (ii) all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful; (iii) you will maintain the accuracy of such information; (iv) if you’re agreeing to this Agreement on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to this Agreement on that organization or entity’s behalf and bind them to this Agreement (in which case, the references to “you” and “your” in these Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity). You also certify that you are legally permitted to use and access the Services and take full responsibility for the selection and use of and access to the Services. This Agreement is void where prohibited by law, and the right to access the Services is revoked in such jurisdictions.

Note that if a child user’s Little Genius account is inactive for at least twelve months (meaning, that account has not received a message through the Little Genius Services in that time), Little Genius’s policy is to delete the personally-identifiable information associated with that child’s account.

                            Access to and use of the Services itself is free, but in the future, we may offer new or additional special features which Little Genius may charge for. Therefore, Little Genius reserves the right to require payment of fees for certain Services.

If you continue to use those Services following such notification, that use constitutes your acceptance of any new or increased charges.

                            Note that, by using the Services, you may receive e-mail or text messages on your phone or mobile device, which may cause you to incur usage charges or other fees or costs in accordance with your wireless or data service plan. Any and all such charges, fees, or costs are your sole responsibility. You should consult with your wireless carrier to determine what rates, charges, fees, or costs may apply to your use of the Services.

                            As part of the Services, Little Genius may send communications (such as SMS, emails, and push notifications)  to Subscribers of a class group. For example, upon adding a new Subscriber to a class group, such new Subscriber will receive a welcome message, instructions on how to stop receiving messages, and information on how to avoid certain charges by downloading the Little Genius Application. Little Genius also may inform Subscribers who have not replied that they automatically will be removed from the class group if they do not reply. Little Genius may send other administrative messages as well. BY SIGNING UP FOR THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO RECEIVE COMMUNICATIONS FROM LITTLE GENIUS, AND YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT EACH USER YOU INVITE AND/OR ADD TO A GROUP HAS CONSENTED TO RECEIVE COMMUNICATIONS FROM LITTLE GENIUS AS WELL AS FROM YOU AND ANYONE ELSE IN THE GROUP.

                        <p>
                            This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Hong Kong without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof. Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement will be finally settled in small claims court or by arbitration in Hong Kong or in a location that is reasonably convenient for you, using the English language in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who will be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS. If you cannot afford or otherwise do not want to pay arbitration filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver of fees, we will consider in good faith any request by you for us to bear the cost of those fees. We will pay any administration fee, arbitration fees and fees and charges of attorneys, experts and witnesses if and to the extent we are required to pay such fees and charges by law or in order to make this arbitration provision enforceable. By agreeing to these terms, you acknowledge that you may not participate in a class action in court or in arbitration, either as a class representative, class member or class opponent. ACCORDINGLY, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO A COURT (OTHER THAN A SMALL CLAIMS COURT) OR TO A JURY TRIAL. Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party will have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator.
